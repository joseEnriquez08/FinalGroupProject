//Description: This program simulates a jewelry shop by running a multithreaded server using a threadpool. Threadpool being an implementation where there is a set number of threads and you resuse them.
//          	This threadpool in this program is split into 3 sets of threads. One set for shop assitants, one set for sofas, and one for the remaining spots in the waiting list.
//          	The clients/connections represent the customers. The connections/clients are stored in a FIFO Queue. As the clients connect to the server, they are enqueued in a linkedList
//          	implementation of a queue. As the shop assitants/threads become available, they dequeue the clients and handle them. If the shop assitant threads are busy and the amount of
//          	clients falls in the range of sofa amount, the sofa threads will then handle the clients and ask if they want to leave or wait. If all the sofa threads are
//          	occupied, then the remaining waiting room threads will handle the clients and ask if they want to leave or wait. The sofa and waiting room threads will only remove clients
//          	from the queue if they choose to leave. This differs from the shop assitant threads that dequeue the clients to talk to them. If there is no room, the client will be booted.
//          	The threads will never terminate, they either a.) handle a client, or b.) continuously check for available clients in the queue.
//          	All shop assitant threads will be using the data stored in the array of structs called: "items". This is data from the text file cartier_catalog_.txt

// Command line arguments: a.out, Number of shop assitants, number of sofas, number of remaing waiting spots.

//TODO:
//  	*fix bugs with sofa threads
//  	*implement remiaing waiting room threads
//  	*handle client responses for shop assitant threads
//
//Bugs:
//  	(1) Assume a client X gets connected to a sofa, and all assitant threads are occupied with other clients. If client x chooses to leave and then another client gets connected to the server.
//  	that new client will be blocked(recieves no data from server). The server will then print out a message saying that a thread detected a null client node. Either "shop assitant detected null"
//  	when calling deque() or "queue is null" when calling getNextNonHandleBySofa(). This should not be happening because im (supposedly) ensuring the threads dont continue until the queue is non-empty
//  
//   
// Notes:
//  	(1) Before a client connects to a sofa thread, the program works as intended. The shop assitants are handling the clients on a first come first serve basis. And the threads are being
//       	resusedclea
