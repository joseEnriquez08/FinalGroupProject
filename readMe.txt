# FinalGroupProject

*With each new file, we have to add it to the compilation list down below.
*Make sure to make only the necessary functions global in incldue.h. 


To compile server.c:  gcc server.c get_Jewelfunc.c readFile.c return_Jewelfunc.c queue.c -lpthread

To compile client.c: gcc -lpthread test.c parseData.c client.c

To run either: a.out

They have to be compiled and ran on separate terminals.
